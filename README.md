# Stegsolve

This is the repository for Stegsolve, an image file analyzer for Steganographic challenges.

This was originally published to [WeChall] by Caesum in 2011.

I have obtained permission (see Licensing.eml) from Caesum to re-release it under the MIT license.

While I made this repository for mainly archival/preservation purposes, further development of
this tool is also possible. Please feel free to reach out if you are interested.
